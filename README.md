# instaclone-python-scripts

A script for the functional testing and another for scraping data from the instagram website.

Don't forget to install the dependencies using the following commands:

```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
You'll also need to download the chrome driver who's available at this [link](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) for running the scripts.
